My name is Jeffrey Philippson and I am a British experimental physicist and technology consultant. I obtained my Ph.D. in experimental physics on the <a href="http://www.trentu.ca/graduatestudies/programsofstudy_queens.php/">Trent-Queen's graduate program</a> in Canada. My research in experimental atomic, molecular and optical physics was carried out as part of the <a href="http://www.trentu.ca/academic/physics/rshiell/">Optical Physics Group</a> at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario. See my <a href="research.html">research summary</a>, <a href="publications.html">publications</a> and <a href="theses.html">theses</a> pages for further details.
</p>

<p>
In February 2012 I returned to the UK to pursue a career as an industrial physicist, moving to Cambridge in May 2012 to begin a technology consultancy position with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PA_Consulting">PA Consulting Group</a>. My current interests lie in product development, process control and optimisation, and precision measurement systems, and I am discovering new avenues of interest every day!

"The angular momentum coupling scheme for hydrogen-fluoride (HF).<br/><br/>The orbital angular momentum, <b>L</b>, is coupled to the internuclear axis via the electrostatic force while the electron spin, <b>S</b> is more weakly coupled via the spin-orbit interaction. The precise orientations of <b>L</b> and <b>S</b> are not well defined so the axial components, &Lambda; and &Sigma; respectively, are combined to form a vector, <b>&Omega;</b>, that is coupled to the rotational angular momentum, <b>R</b>, to form <b>J</b>. The nuclear angular momenta, <b>I</b><sub>F</sub> and <b>I</b><sub>H</sub>, are coupled in order of their contributions to the hyperfine energy to form first <b>F</b><sub>1</sub> and then <b>F</b>.

"Optical layout for saturated absorption spectroscopy of lithium. A half-wave plate (&lambda;/2) and a pair of polarizing beam-splitters (PBS) are used to obtain counterpropagating coaxial beams passing through the lithium cell with a tunable intensity ratio. The low-power, horizontally-polarized probe-beam is transmitted through each PBS and detected by a photodiode, while the high-power, vertically polarized pump-beam is reflected by each PBS.",

"A calibrated polarimeter setup. A beam-expander (BE) increases the beam-width to ~8 mm. A pair of polarizing beam-splitters (PBS) produce a horizontally-polarized beam with which to test the calibration method. The first <i>s</i>-polarized reflection is sent to an optical spectrum analyzer (OSA), while the weak second reflection serves as a reference for power normalization. The polarimeter itself consists of a quarter-wave plate (&lambda;/4) and linear polarizer (LP) in rotational mounts. The calibration method employs an additional linear polarizer (LP') set to make S<sub>1</sub>&asymp;S<sub>2</sub> and is removed for regular beam analysis. The retarder is rotated via a worm gear by the stepper motor (SM) and the transmitted light is measured by a photodiode (PD) after attentuation by a neutral density filter (ND). The microcontroller (&mu;C) controls the SM and records the PD voltages for transmission to a computer.<br/><br/>See our <a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/AO.50.005382'>publication</a> for more details."
