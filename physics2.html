If you haven't read the piece, &ldquo;Why are electromagnetic waves transverse waves?&rdquo;, then I highly recommend doing so before continuing.
</p>

<p>
Having already considered the effect of relativistic length contraction on photon polarisation, it is interesting to ponder the corresponding effect of time dilation. We would observe a metre ruler carried by a photon length contracted to zero along its direction of propagation and equivalently we observe the photon's wristwatch standing still. From the photon's point of view, the metre ruler has the expected length and its watch ticks at the normal rate, because both are at rest in its inertial frame.
</p>

<p>
Considering the effect of time dilation led me to ask a question I had never asked before: are photons stable particles? The other 3 electroweak gauge bosons, the W<sup>+</sup>, W<sup>-</sup> and Z<sub>0</sub> that together mediate the nuclear weak force, are all unstable particles with lifetimes on the order of half a yocto-second, where a yocto-second (ys) is 10<sup>-24</sup> seconds or a trillionth of a trillionth of a second.<sup>[]</sup> In contrast, photons appear to be very stable; a telescope observing a distant quasar is capturing photons that have travelled through space for billions of years without decaying. We know that relativistic effects can make the properties of the zero rest mass photon differ from its weak force mediating cousins.
</p>

<p>
As a comparison, consider the example of <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Particles/muonatm.html">atmospheric muons</a>, which are created through the interaction of cosmic rays (high energy protons) with molecules in the atmosphere at altitudes in the region of 15 km above sea level. Muons are heavy leptons and are unstable particles with a lifetime of approximately 2 &mu;s. Even if they could travel at the speed of light and were not slowedtravelling in a vacuum, they would still only travel 600 m in 2 &mu;s, so we would naively expect that a vanishingly small fraction would be detected at sea level. Furthermore, muons are charged particles that lose a significant amount of energy as they travel through the atmosphere, so even though they are created with high energy, travelling close to the speed of light, they are subsequently slowed significantly.
</p>

<p>
The fact that the flux of high energy atmospheric muons at sea level is detectable can be explained by the effect of time dilation. Imagine the muons studying their watches as they pass through the atmosphere; on average they will see approximately 2 &mu;s elapse before they decay. But if we look at their watches, we will see them running much slower, because they (and their watches) are moving at relativistic speeds relative to us. We know that time periods are dilated according to <i>t</i> = <i>t</i><sub>0</sub>&gamma;.

$$
t = \frac{t_0}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
$$

Calculations based on representative energies measured for atmospheric muons show that the lifetimes of the muons are multiplied by a time dilation factor of &gamma; = 30 - 40.<sup>[]</sup>
</p>

<p>
What then of the photon? Imagine for argument's sake that the photon was an unstable particle with a lifetime of 0.5 ys, similar to the other electroweak gauge bosons. As <i>v</i> &rarr; <i>c</i>, the dilation factor becomes infinite, &gamma; &rarr; &infin;, so photons travelling at the speed of light would have their 0.5 ys lifetime stretched out to last forever. A photon looking at its watch would only see 0.5 ys elapse before it decayed, but we would never see a photon decay, consistent with what is observed.

<a href="javascript:;" onmousedown="toggleDiv('mass');">Does kinetic energy exert a gravitational attraction?</a>
<br/>
<div id="mass" style="display:none">

<p>
We can generalise the title question slight by simply asking, is the kinetic energy of a particle / system / object part of it's mass? In a sense this is a matter of definition and it has become conventional to use the word mass to refer only to mass as observed from the rest frame. A potential problem with this definition is that it can obscure the true meaning of mass-energy equivalence. Mass is quantity that measures two things: inertia and gravity. All energy has inertia and all energy is a source of the gravitational field, so all energy is mass, including kinetic energy.
</p>

<!--The equivalence of mass and energy was one of the great insights that came with Einstein's introduction of special relativity in 1905-->

<p>
The relativistic expression for the total energy, <i>E</i>, is the energy-momentum relation:

$$
E = \sqrt{p^2c^2 + m^2c^4}.
$$

In the rest frame we have <i>p</i> = 0, giving:

$$
E(p=0)=E_0 = mc^2,
$$

which is Einstein's famous equation as he originally introduced it. In fact, even with non-zero momentum the equation holds with the introduction of relativistic mass, <i>m</i><sub>rel</sub>:

$$
E = \sqrt{p^2c^2 + m^2c^4} = m_\textnormal{rel}c^2.
$$

Relativistic mass as a concept is not favoured by most authors these days and often not introduced in special relativity courses, but the form can be easily determined from the above equation and using <i>p</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>m</i><sub>rel</sub><i>v</i>:

$$
m_\textnormal{rel} = \frac{m}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
$$

Another way to think of relativistic mass is as the sum of the rest mass of a system and its kinetic energy. This can be seen by substituting the expression for relativistic mass into the equation for total energy:

$$
E = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.
$$

Expanding the square root using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_theorem#Newton's_generalized_binomial_theorem">generalised binomial theorem</a>, we have:

$$
E = mc^2\left(1 + \frac{v^2}{c^2} + \frac{3v^4}{8c^4} + \mathcal{O}\left[\left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^6\right]\right).
$$

Multiplying through the first two terms we see that the first term is the rest energy, while the second term is the Newtonian expression for kinetic energy: 

$$
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mc^2\left(\frac{3v^4}{8c^4} + \mathcal{O}\left[\left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^6\right]\right).
$$

In fact, all terms other than the rest energy term are part of the kinetic energy, as can be seen from the fact that they drop to zero in the rest frame. The third and subsequent terms are relativistic corrections to the kinetic energy that only give a significant contribution as <i>v</i>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;<i>c</i>.

<blockquote>
&ldquo;In other words, <b>mass is not conserved</b>. The mass of clay after the collision is larger than the mass of of clay before the collision. Total energy can only be conserved if total energy is converted into an &lsquo;equivalent&rsquo; amount of mass.&rdquo;<sup>[2]</sup><br/>

Even the entirely standard description of a photon as a <i>massless particle</i> is highly misleading; photons carry inertia and exert a gravitational attraction. The fact that if you were to accelerate into the rest frame of a photon, its mass would drop to zero

<a href="javascript:;" onmousedown="toggleDiv('mass');">What is mass?</a>
<br/>
<div id="mass" style="display:none">

<p id="inline">
All mass is energy and all energy is mass, as Einstein famously showed, with his revelation that <i>E</i> = <i>mc</i><sup>2</sup>. In spite of its status as the most recognisable equation of all time, it is easy to overlook the implications of this relationship. If mass is energy, then the sources of mass are simply the sources of energy, including all kinetic and potential energy.
</p>

<p id="inline">
Consider a ball flying through the air. Its mass as observed from your inertial frame will be larger than that of the same ball at rest, due to the kinetic energy, <i>K</i>, of its motion by <i>K</i>/<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>. The ball at rest will have a larger mass than the same ball at absolute zero of temperature by the amount of the thermal kinetic energy stored in the vibrations of the molecules making up the ball. Einstein’s 1905 article, &ldquo;<i>On the electrodynamics of moving bodies</i>&rdquo;<sup>[1]</sup>, that introduced special relativity to the world, used this as an example, showing that the mass of a quantity of gas increases with temperature by the amount of its thermal kinetic energy. 
</p>

<p id="inline">
Potential energy is also a source of mass. A compressed (or stretched) spring stores elastic potential energy, <i>U</i>, and the mass of the spring is greater than the mass of the uncompressed spring by <i>U</i>/<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>. The same effect can be seen in the microscopic view in atomic binding energy. A hydrogen atom has a lower mass than the combined mass of its constituent proton and electron. Imagine the bond between proton and electron as a spring in which potential energy is stored as they are pulled apart; it is not a harmonic potential, but there is a restoring force. The mass of the hydrogen atom increases as additional potential energy is stored. The greatest mass achievable occurs when the proton and electron are separated to infinity. 
</p>

<p id="inline">
The binding energy of a system of particles is equivalent to the work done on the system to assemble the particles from infinity at a constant speed (any acceleration would require additional work to overcome the inertia). Consider a pair of electrons with infinite separation: work must be done on the system to bring them together, overcoming their mutual repulsion, adding energy and increasing the mass of the system. Now consider an electron and a proton with infinite separation: they have a mutual attraction and hence they do the work to bring themselves together, losing energy and hence decreasing the mass of the system. A more rigorous, although ultimately equivalent way to see this is to consider the work, <i>W</i>, needed to maintain the constant velocity against the mutual attraction that would tend to make them accelerate. In that case the applied force, <b>F</b>, would point outwards, in the opposite direction to the displacement line element, d<b>s</b>, along the path, \(\mathcal{P}\), making the work negative:

$$
W = \int_\mathcal{P} \mathbf{F}.d\mathbf{s}
$$

This explains why the maximally stretched case for the hydrogen atom, which is the maximum mass case, is equal in mass to the rest masses of the isolated proton and electron. For a bound system, the potential energy must be lower than that of the isolated constituents, otherwise it would not be bound. 
</p>

<p id="inline">
If all mass is energy then you might expect that massless particles had zero energy, but in fact this is just confusing terminology. Photons are conventionally referred to as massless particles, even though they have inertia and exert a gravitational attraction, the two defining properties of mass. In fact, they have zero <i>rest mass</i>, which tells us that in the rest frame of a photon it would have zero mass (and hence also zero energy), which means that the energy of a photon is entirely kinetic energy. If you were to accelerate into a photon’s rest frame then it would cease to exist! It is no coincidence then that nature conspires to make it impossible to share an inertial frame with a photon, because they travel at the speed of light with respect to any inertial frame.
</p>

<p id="inline">
In an undergraduate course on special relativity, students typically don’t spend much time thinking about the implications of <i>E</i> = <i>mc</i><sup>2</sup>. The equation is just an identity between two quantities and is not a practical way to perform calculations. The energy-momentum relationship is much more practical tool:

$$
E = \sqrt{p^2c^2+m_0^2c^4}
$$

Nonetheless, they are both expressions for total energy and hence they are equivalent. The only assumptions needed to derive one from the other are the definition of momentum, <i>p</i> = <i>mv</i> = <i>&gamma;m</i><sub>0</sub><i>v</i>, and the relativistic mass formula, <i>m</i> = <i>m</i><sub>0</sub><i>&gamma;</i>.

$$
E^2 = m^2v^2c^2 + m^2\left(1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)c^4
$$

$$
E^2 = m^2c^4
$$

$$
E = mc^2
$$

<p id="inline">
The take-home message is simple. All energy of any form has inertia and exerts a gravitational attraction. All energy is mass and all mass is energy.
