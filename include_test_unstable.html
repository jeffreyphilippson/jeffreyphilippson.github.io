If you haven't read the piece, &ldquo;Why are electromagnetic waves transverse waves?&rdquo;, then I highly recommend doing so before continuing.

Having already considered the effect of relativistic length contraction on photon polarisation, it is interesting to ponder the corresponding effect of time dilation. A metre ruler carried by a photon is length contracted to zero along its direction of propagation and equivalently we observe the photon's wristwatch standing still. From the photon's point of view, the metre ruler has the expected length and its watch ticks at the normal rate, because both are at rest in its inertial frame.

Considering the effect of time dilation led me to ask a question I had never asked before: are photons stable particles? The other 3 electroweak gauge bosons, the W<sup>+</sup>, W<sup>-</sup> and Z<sub>0</sub> that together mediate the nuclear weak force, are all unstable particles with lifetimes of approximately 0.4 yocto-seconds, where a yocto-second (ys) is 10<sup>-24</sup> seconds or a trillionth of a trillionth of a second.<sup>[]</sup> In contrast, photons appear to be very stable; a telescope observing a distant quasar is capturing photons that have travelled through space for billions of years without decaying. We know that relativistic effects can make the properties of the zero rest mass photon differ from its weak force mediating cousins.
</p>

<p>
As a comparison, consider the example of <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Particles/muonatm.html">atmospheric muons</a>, which are created through the interaction of cosmic rays (high energy protons) with molecules in the atmosphere at altitudes in the region of 15 km above sea level. Muons are heavy leptons and are unstable particles with a lifetime of approximately 2 &mu;s. Even if they could travel at the speed of light and were travelling in a vacuum, they would still only travel 600 m in 2 &mu;s, so we would naively expect that a vanishingly small fraction would be detected at sea level. Furthermore, muons are charged particles that lose a significant amount of energy as they travel through the atmosphere, so even though they are created with high energy, travelling close to the speed of light, they are subsequently slowed significantly.
</p>

<p>
The fact that the flux of high energy atmospheric muons at sea level is detectable can be explained by the effect of time dilation. Imagine the muons studying their watches as they pass through the atmosphere; on average they will see approximately 2 &mu;s elapse before they decay. But if we look at their watches, we will see them running much slower, because they (and their watches) are moving at relativistic speeds relative to us. We know that time periods are dilated according to <i>t</i> = <i>t</i><sub>0</sub>&gamma;.

$$
t = \frac{t_0}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
$$

Calculations based on representative energies measured for atmospheric muons show that the lifetimes of the muons are multiplied by a time dilation factor of &gamma; = 30 - 40.<sup>[]</sup>
</p>

<p>
What then of the photon? Imagine for argument's sake that the photon was an unstable particle with a lifetime of 0.5 ys, similar to the other electroweak gauge bosons. As <i>v</i> &rarr; <i>c</i>, the dilation factor becomes infinite, &gamma; &rarr; &infin;, so photons travelling at the speed of light would have their 0.5 ys lifetime stretched out to last forever. A photon looking at its watch would only see 0.5 ys elapse before it decayed, but we would never see a photon decay, consistent with what is observed.
