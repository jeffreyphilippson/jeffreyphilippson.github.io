<font color="#485E49"><b><i>Jeffrey N. Philippson</i></b></font> was born in Manchester, UK in 1979, living there until the age of 20. Between April 2000 and April 2004 he split his time between Brighton, East Sussex and Amsterdam in the Netherlands, obtaining an M.Phys. undergraduate degree in Physics with Astrophysics from the <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/">University of Sussex</a> and developing skills as a hair-stylist respectively.
</p>

<p id="inline">
His early academic interests were primarily on the astrophysics side, however this evolved during his studies leading to an <a href="theses.html">undergraduate thesis</a> in atomic and molecular physics, and the subsequent receipt of a <a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/improving/fellowships/home.htm">Marie Curie Fellowship</a> from the European Commission to work in the experimental <a href="http://www.nat.vu.nl/en/research/atoms_molecules_lasers/fundamental-physics-at-the-atomic-scale/index.asp">Atomic, Molecular and Laser Physics group</a> at the <a href="http://www.vu.nl/en/index.asp">VU University, Amsterdam</a>.
</p>

<p id="inline">
In 2005 he moved to Canada to begin graduate studies in Experimental Physics on the <a href="http://www.queensu.ca/sgs/facultystaff/domestic/trent.html">Queen's-Trent Graduate Program</a>, undertaking graduate coursework at <a href="http://www.queensu.ca/">Queen's University</a> in Kingston, Ontario, and research as part of the <a href="http://www.trentu.ca/academic/physics/rshiell/">Optical Physics Group</a> at <a href="http://www.trentu.ca/">Trent University</a> in Peterborough, Ontario, completing his M.Sc. in September 2007 and Ph.D. in January 2012.
</p>

<p id="inline">
During his 6 years in Canada Jeffrey formed many close friendships, integrated into the North American chemical and AMO physics communities through attendance and presentations at numerous conferences, and perhaps picked up a touch of the accent.
</p>

<p id="inline">
Having defended his <a href="theses.html">doctoral thesis</a> in January 2012, Jeffrey returned to the UK determined to apply the <a href="resume.html">broad range of skills</a> he had acquired in an academic context to the solution of real-world problems. In May 2012 he began a career in technology consultancy, with the <a href="http://www.paconsulting.com/">PA Consulting Group</a>, finding it to be an excellent fit for his skills and interests.

Jeffrey is a keen squash player and wall-climber, an experienced DJ and juggler, and is re-discovering the piano after an 18-year hiatus.
