The angular momentum coupling scheme for hydrogen-fluoride (HF).<br/><br/>
The orbital angular momentum, <b>L</b>, is coupled to the internuclear axis via the electrostatic force while the electron spin, <b>S</b> is more weakly coupled via the spin-orbit interaction. The precise orientations of <b>L</b> and <b>S</b> are not well defined so the axial components, &Lambda; and &Sigma; respectively, are combined to form a vector, <b>&Omega;</b>, that is coupled to the rotational angular momentum, <b>R</b>, to form <b>J</b>. The nuclear angular momenta, <b>I</b><sub>F</sub> and <b>I</b><sub>H</sub>, are coupled in order of their contributions to the hyperfine energy to form first <b>F</b><sub>1</sub> and then <b>F</b>.
