Experimental and theoretical investigations of highly-excited molecules are presented
that advance the current state of knowledge of intramolecular interactions in highly-excited
molecular states.
</p>
<p>
A quantitative analysis of intramolecular interactions in excited hydrogen fluoride
is presented, in which the rotational levels of the B <sup>1</sup>&Sigma;<sup>+</sup>, <i>v</i> = 29 vibronic level are shown to mix with the corresponding <i>e</i>-parity components of the C <sup>1</sup>&Pi;, <i>v</i> = 0 level. Extrapolating the experimentally-derived mixing parameter to the unperturbed limit reveals an unperturbed value of the <i>a</i><sub>F</sub> hyperfine parameter of 4132(25) MHz.
</p>
<p>
Coupling energies between the ion-pair curve and long-range asymptotes of covalent
states are calculated for a large number of alkali–alkali collision channels, revealing
the dependence on the internuclear distance at which the crossing takes place and
forming a foundational step for the calculation of cross-sections and rate coefficients
for different charge-exchange and other processes.
</p>
<p>
To advance the experimental investigation of these systems, optical instrumentation
and associated control systems have been designed and constructed for cooling
and trapping lithium in preparation for experimental studies of cold-collisions that
will be informed by, and ultimately a test of, some of these calculated ionic–covalent
coupling energies. A novel scheme for systematic optimization of peak-locking has
been developed and implemented, providing a rigorous assessment of the optimal
experimental parameters. A side-of-filter offset-locking scheme was implemented,
characterizing and correcting for a previously unexplained offset in the error-signal.
</p>
A novel calibrated polarimetry scheme is demonstrated, correcting for the primary
sources of uncertainty relating to manufacturing tolerances and experimental errors.
The calibrated set of polarization measurements is used to examine the purity of the
optical polarization state in the light sources to be used for trapping lithium.

<p id="thesis_title">Development of Optoelectronic Devices and Computational Tools for the Production and Manipulation of Heavy Rydberg Systems</p>

Experimental and theoretical progress has been made toward the production and manipulation
of novel atomic and molecular states. The design, construction and characterization
of a driver for an acousto–optic modulator is presented, which achieves a
maximum diffraction efficiency of 54 % at 200 MHz, using a commercial modulator. A
novel design is presented for a highly sensitive optical spectrum analyzer for displaying
laser mode structure in real time. Utilizing programmable microcontrollers to read
data from a CMOS image sensor illuminated by the diffraction pattern from a Fabry–
P&eacute;rot interferometer, this device can operate with beam powers as low as 3.3 &mu;W,
at a fraction of the cost of equivalent products. Computational results are presented
analyzing the behaviour of a model quantum system in the vicinity of an avoided
crossing. The results are compared with calculations based on the Landau–Zener
formula, with discussion of its limitations. Further computational work is focused on
simulating expected conditions in the implementation of a technique for coherent control
quantum states atomic and molecular beams. The work presented provides tools
to further the aim of producing large, mono-energetic populations of heavy Rydberg
systems.

The boundary between the classical and quantum domains in conventional and
heavy Rydberg atoms is investigated through modelling of their response to the
application of a Stark field. The applicability of a reduced mass, single particle
model of the heavy Rydberg atom is constructed and its behaviour is compared
with the conventional Rydberg atom.
